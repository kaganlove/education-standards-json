In grade seven, students examine the history and geography of human societies from 1600 to the present. They learn about the growing interaction among these societies as well as the exchange of ideas, beliefs, technologies, and commodities among them. Students also address the continuing growth of the political and economic ideas that shaped the modern world. They study the concepts of reason and authority, the natural rights of human beings, the divine right of kings, experimentalism in science, the development of limited government, and the roots of modern-day tensions and issues."
