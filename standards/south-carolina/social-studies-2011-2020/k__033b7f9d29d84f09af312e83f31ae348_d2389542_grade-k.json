The classroom serves as a model of society in which decisions are made with a sense of individual responsibility and with respect for the rules by which we all must live. The students learn about the nature of their physical environment—home, school, neighborhood, and town, including how the people in their community provide goods and services. They also learn about the role of families now and in the past; the need for rules and authority; and the values of American democracy as reflected in the traditions and history of the nation."
