        "The focus for social studies in grade eight is the history of South Carolina and the role that the state and its people have played in the development of the United States as a nation. Students learn about the state's development during colonial times; the growth of the American ideal, which led to the break with England; and the rising controversy about slavery, which led to the Civil War. The continued study of South Carolina from Reconstruction to the present, including the struggle for social and economic justice waged by the people of South Carolina, further allows students to see the progress that the state has made and also to visualize the future challenges yet to be met and overcome."
