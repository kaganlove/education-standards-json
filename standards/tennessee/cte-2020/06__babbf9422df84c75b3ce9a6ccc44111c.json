Design a model of a transportation technology\nbased on specific criteria and constraints. Test the model’s performance. Modify single\naspects of the model’s design and retest the model. Graph and analyze data from the test.\nWrite an explanation based on the data analysis describing how the model could be further\nmodified to optimize the design. Include any reasons why the test may have produced data\nthat does not reflect the actual impact of the change in the test variable. For example, have\nstudents design and build a water bottle rocket. Divide the class into groups and have the various\ngroups each test a different variable such as ballast, nose cone design, fin size, fin shape, waterto-air mixture, and bottle size. After each group presents their findings, assign the students to\nconstruct a rocket that will reach the maximum altitude.",

Students build\nand test their plane three times, recording the time aloft in each test. Students make a\nmodification to their plane design. Students should be encouraged to only modify a single\nvariable. Students build and test their modified plane three times as with their original plane. This process may be repeated multiple times.
