      "description": "Understand and apply language cues and conventions to construct and communicate meaning when writing including: Pragmatic cues and conventions: selecting and using language that includes people across cultures, races, genders, ages, and abilities, and avoids common usage problems including imprecision and the use of jargon, slang, euphemism, clichés, gobbledygook, and “abusages” (such as “Me and John…”, “I can’t get no…,”“Like,…”). Textual cues and conventions: creating written texts that are unified (i.e., all elements combined to form a single whole or “oneness”) and coherent (i.e., consistent, logically arranged, and connected). Syntactic cues and conventions: using sentences that are varied in form (e.g., parallelism, inversion, subordination); are free of misplaced qualifiers and dangling qualifiers; show agreement of subject and verb, consistency in verb tense, pronoun agreement, and clear pronoun reference; and use correctly that/which, who/ whom, and punctuation. Semantic/lexical/morphological cues and conventions: using words correctly including prepositions (e.g., suited to, suited for), homonyms (e.g., to, too, two), plurals and possessives (e.g., the cat’s paws, students’ projects, people’s pets), and meaning (e.g., then/than; few, fewer/less, lesser). Graphophonic cues and conventions: recognizing and using Canadian spelling conventions and clear pronunciation to aid spelling (e.g., accept, except). Other cues and conventions: using appropriate written elements (e.g., font size, type face, formatting); writing legibly with appropriate speed and control; using communication elements such as neatness, underlining, indentations, spacing, and margins to enhance clarity and legibility of communication.",
