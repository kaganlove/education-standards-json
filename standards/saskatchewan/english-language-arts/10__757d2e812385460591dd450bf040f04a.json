Syntactic cues and conventions: selecting and using formal written sentences that are meaningful, clear, correctly punctuated, and devoid of ambiguous expressions; demonstrating control over such elements as subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement, verb forms, and parallelism (average written sentence length – 11.7 words). Semantic/Lexical/Morphological cues and conventions: using words precisely, accurately, and for effect (e.g., to create imagery, to communicate figuratively, to communicate symbolically, as an allusion). Graphophonic cues and conventions: using the sounds of letters and syllables and the placement of accents to determine the pronunciation and spelling of words. Other cues and conventions: using communication elements such as handwriting, consistent font, neatness, underlining, indentations, spacing, and margins to enhance the clarity and the legibility of communication; writing legibly with appropriate speed and control; choosing appropriate font size and style when word processing.",
