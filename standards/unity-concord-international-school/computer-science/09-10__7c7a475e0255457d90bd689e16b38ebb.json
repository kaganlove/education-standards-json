Students make and justify claims about potential and/or actual privacy implications of policies, laws, or ethics and consider the associated tradeoffs, focusing on society and the economy. \n\nFor example, students could explore the case of companies tracking online shopping behaviors in order to decide which products to target to consumers. Students could evaluate the ethical and legal dilemmas of collecting such data without consumer knowledge in order to profit companies. \n\nAlternatively, students could evaluate the implications of net neutrality laws on society's access to information and on the impacts to businesses of varying sizes.",

      "description": "Computing devices are often integrated with other systems, including biological, mechanical, and social systems. A medical device can be embedded inside a person to monitor and regulate his or her health, a hearing aid (a type of assistive device) can filter out certain frequencies and magnify others, a monitoring device installed in a motor vehicle can track a person’s driving patterns and habits, and a facial recognition device can be integrated into a security system to identify a person. The creation of integrated or embedded systems is not an expectation at this level. Students might select an embedded device such as a car stereo, identify the types of data (radio station presets, volume level) and procedures (increase volume, store/recall saved station, mute) it includes, and explain how the implementation details are hidden from the user.",
