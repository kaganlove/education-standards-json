They enjoy physical activities for the pleasure experienced from simply moving and may not associate the activity with the development of physical fitness. They participate in physical activity intermittently for short periods of time, will accumulate a relatively high volume of total activity, and have fun while doing so. They recognize physiological signs associated with participation in moderate to vigorous physical activity (e.g., sweating, fast heart rate, and heavy breathing). Students at this level possess basic knowledge of the components of health-related fitness (e.g., cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and body composition)."

Students knowingly select and participate in activities during their leisure time that are moderate to vigorous in nature and that they find enjoyable. They recognize that participation in moderate to vigorous physical activity has both temporary and lasting effects on the body and voluntarily chose to engage in activities that contribute to improved health.

        "Young children are very active and enjoy learning and mastering new ways to move and be active. Students achieve mature forms in the basic locomotor skills and vary the manner in which these skills are performed in relationship to changing conditions and expectations. They demonstrate smooth transitions between sequential locomotor skills. Students show progress toward achieving mature form in the more complex manipulative skills (e.g., foot dribble) and achieve mature form in the less complex manipulative skills (e.g., underhand throw). They demonstrate control in traveling, weight-bearing, and balance activities on a variety of body parts."
