They demonstrate leadership by holding themselves and others responsible for following safe practices, rules, procedures, and etiquette in all physical activity settings. They are able to respond to potentially explosive interactions with others by mediating and settling conflicts. Students synthesize and evaluate knowledge regarding the role of physical activity in a culturally diverse society. They make enlightened personal choices for engaging in physical activity over the life span, recognizing the influence of age, disability, gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and culture. They develop a personal philosophy of participation, reflecting inclusive practices in physical activity settings."

They willingly participate in physical activities on a regular basis that contribute to the attainment of and maintenance of personal physical activity goals. Students at this age make conscious decisions regarding their physical activity participation and assume a mature role in managing their participation based on needs, personal interests, capabilities and resources. They possess adequate movement capabilities and behavioral skills that provide a basis for continued learning and regular physical activity participation. They can independently apply appropriate training principles to their own physical activity and can utilize pertinent scientific principles to enhance their participation in a specific activity or sport. In addition, students demonstrate an understanding of how and why adult patterns of physical activity participation change throughout life and are capable of implementing meaningful strategies to deal with those changes."
