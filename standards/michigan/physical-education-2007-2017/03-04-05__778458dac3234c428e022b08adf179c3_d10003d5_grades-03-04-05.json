Students achieve mature forms in the basic nonlocomotor and manipulative skills. They demonstrate locomotor, nonlocomotor, and manipulative skills for performance outcomes (e.g., hitting targets). They use these skills in dynamic and complex environments (e.g., rhythmic movement to music) and in combination with each other. Students also acquire some specialized skills basic to a movement form (i.e., basketball chest pass, softball fielding with a glove)."
