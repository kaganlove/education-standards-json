Physical activities provide a positive outlet for competition with peers and a means of gaining the respect and recognition of others. Physical activity can increase self-confidence and self-esteem as students discover renewed enjoyment in participation. Physical activity can provide confidence as students start to take steps toward independence. Challenge is found both in experiencing high levels of competition and in learning new and/or different activities. As students experience a greater awareness of feelings, the avenues of self-expression, provided by rhythmic movement, gymnastics, and other sport activities, become increasingly important."

They recognize the role of physical activity in understanding diversity and continue to include and support each other, respecting the limitations and strengths of group members. Students move from merely identifying and following rules, procedures, safe practices, ethical behavior, and positive forms of social interaction to reflecting upon their role in physical activity settings and the benefits of physical activity. They have well-developed cooperation skills and are able to accomplish group/team goals in both cooperative and competitive activities. Adolescents seek greater independence from adults and effectively work independently and in groups to complete assigned tasks. They make appropriate decisions to resolve conflicts arising from the powerful influence of peers, and they practice appropriate problem-solving techniques to resolve conflicts, when necessary, in competitive activities."

They participate in physical activities that address each component of health-related fitness, including cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and body composition. Students know the components of fitness and how these relate to their overall fitness status. Students monitor their own heart rate, breathing rate, perceived exertion, and recovery rate during and following strenuous physical activity. They assess their personal fitness status for each component and use this information to assist in development of individualized physical fitness goals, with little help from the teacher. Students show progress towards knowing the various principles of training (e.g., threshold, overload, specificity) and how these principles can be utilized in improving one's level of physical fitness."
