The study of literature and writers of the United States and throughout the world gives students an appreciation of other cultures in a global society. Through a comprehensive literature program, students learn to make connections between literary texts and their own lives, to develop their own perspectives, and to analyze different viewpoints toward events, circumstances, and issues in our complex society."

Students need to learn how to vary their approaches according to the type of text (e.g., written, spoken, or visual, including formal, informal, literary, and practical), their purpose in reading, and their own knowledge and experiences. Therefore, students should read for a variety of purposes and within a variety of contexts in order to become proficient and knowledgeable readers. Discovering various purposes and exploring and studying different kinds of texts will enable students to become lifelong readers and productive members of society and the workplace."
