The study of literature and writers of the United States and throughout the world gives students an appreciation of other cultures in a global society. Through a comprehensive literature program, students learn to make connections between literary texts and their own lives, to develop their own perspectives, and to analyze different viewpoints toward events, circumstances, and issues in our complex society."
