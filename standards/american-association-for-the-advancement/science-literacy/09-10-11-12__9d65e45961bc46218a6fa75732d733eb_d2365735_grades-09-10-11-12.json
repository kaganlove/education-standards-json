The disadvantage is that decisions must be made by government officials, often with input from the public, on the basis of factors that are much more complex than profit alone. In addition, there may be less incentive to work as efficiently when the profit motive is absent and the system does not respond as quickly to short-term variations in supply and demand that the free-market system allows.",

The anticipation of profit motivates individual initiative, innovation, and hard work in a free-market economy. Problems may arise if one business achieves a monopoly in the delivery of a particular product or service, so that the motivation to deliver that product or service efficiently is no longer present.
