      "description": "Analyze and solve pairs of simultaneous linear equations. Clarification 1: Understand that solutions to a system of two linear equations in two variables correspond to points of intersection of their graphs, because points of intersection satisfy both equations simultaneously. Clarification 2: olve systems of two linear equations in two variables algebraically, and estimate solutions by graphing the equations. Solve simple cases by inspection. Example 1: 3x + 2y = 5 and 3x + 2y = 6 have no solution because 3x + 2y cannot simultaneously be 5 and 6. Clarification 3: Solve real-world and mathematical problems leading to two linear equations in two variables. Example 2: Given coordinates for two pairs of points, determine whether the line through the first pair of points intersects the line through the second pair.",
