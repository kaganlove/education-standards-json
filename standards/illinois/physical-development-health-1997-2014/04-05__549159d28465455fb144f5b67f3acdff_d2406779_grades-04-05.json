        "Nutrition, exercise, rest, hygiene and safety are the bases for personal, family and occupational health. From an early age, students can recognize healthy habits and understand why they are important. As students become more sophisticated in their understanding, they learn and can adopt a variety of ways to minimize illness and enhance health. Learners will be able to apply the effects of health-related actions to success in the workplace. Students who develop an effective understanding of basic health promotion can establish the foundation for achieving and maintaining personal health and well-being by making informed wellness decisions now and throughout their lives."

        "Physical performance involves competency in a wide range of motor, non-motor and manipulative skills. Learning in this area is developmental, building simple movements into more complex patterns. Learning to follow directions and rules enhances enjoyment and success in both recreational and competitive sports. Working toward higher levels of competence, students learn how to maintain health and fitness as individuals and as members of teams."
