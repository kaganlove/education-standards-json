        "People develop and use technology to enhance their quality of life. Technologies like the automobile, nuclear power, genetic engineering, and factory automation have enhanced our mobility, enabled us to harness new energy resources, increased food production, reduced disease, and freed people from tedious or dangerous tasks. While each of these technologies has very distinct advantages, they also have clear disadvantages that need to be weighed carefully by those who live in a technological society. Given the rapid growth in technological capability, it is important that every citizen take an active role in promoting the common good by making informed decisions about risks and benefits of technology. To be active citizens, students need to understand the positive and negative impacts of technology on society and the environment. They need to weigh carefully the benefits and risks of technologies, and make informed decisions about technological issues."

By coordinating and processing resources, these systems help to provide products and services such as food, clothing, shelter, entertainment, health care, security, and other necessities and comforts of life. Though often subtle, these systems are everywhere in our world and, without exception, they impact all of us."

On the whole, technology has been a powerful force in the development of civilization, all the more so as its link with science has been forged. Technology-like language, ritual, values, commerce, and the arts-is an intrinsic part of a cultural system and it both shapes and reflects the system's values. In today's world, technology is a complex social enterprise that includes not only research, design, and crafts but also finance, manufacturing, management, labor, marketing, and maintenance."
