In order to make an accurate prediction, one or two attempts of differing times would not be enough. The robot may also collect temperature data from a sensor, but that data would not be relevant for the task. Students must also make accurate measurements of the distance the robot travels in order to develop a valid prediction. Students could record the temperature at noon each day as a basis to show that temperatures are higher in certain months of the year. If temperatures are not recorded on non-school days or are recorded incorrectly or at different times of the day, the data would be incomplete and the ideas being communicated could be inaccurate.
