Students are required to make several connections—relate ideas within the content area or among content areas—and have to select or devise one approach among many alternatives on how the situation can be solved. Many on-demand assessment instruments will not include any assessment activities that could be classified as Level 4. However, standards, goals, and objectives can be stated in such a way as to expect students to perform extended thinking. “Develop generalizations of the results obtained and the strategies used and apply them to new problem situations,” is an example of a Grade 8 objective that is a Level 4. Many, but not all, performance assessments and open-ended assessment activities requiring significant thought will be Level 4. \n\nLevel 4 requires complex reasoning, experimental design and planning, and probably will require an extended period of time either for the science investigation required by an objective, or for carrying out the multiple steps of an assessment item. However, the extended time period is not a distinguishing factor if the required work is only repetitive and does not require applying significant conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking. For example, if a student has to take the water temperature from a river each day for a month and then construct a graph, this would be classified as a Level 2 activity. However, if the student conducts a river study that requires taking into consideration a number of variables, this would be a Level 4. Some examples that represent but do not constitute all of a Level 4 performance are:\n\nBased on provided data from a complex experiment that is novel to the student, deduct the fundamental relationship between several controlled variables.\nConduct an investigation, from specifying a problem to designing and carrying out an experiment, to analyzing its data and forming conclusions. ",

At this level students are engaged in first draft writing or brief extemporaneous speaking for a limited number of purposes and audiences.  Students are beginning to connect ideas using a simple organizational structure.  For example, students may be engaged in note-taking, outlining or simple summaries.  Text may be limited to one paragraph. Students demonstrate a basic understanding and appropriate use of such reference materials as a dictionary, thesaurus, or web site. Some examples that represent but do not constitute all of Level 2 performance are:\nConstruct compound sentences.\nUse simple organizational strategies to structure written work.\nWrite summaries that contain the main idea of the reading selection and pertinent details. ",

      "description": "Level 1 requires the student to write or recite simple facts.  This writing or recitation does not include complex synthesis or analysis but basic ideas.  The students are engaged in listing ideas or words as in a brainstorming activity prior to written composition, are engaged in a simple spelling or vocabulary assessment or are asked to write simple sentences. Students are expected to write and speak using Standard English conventions.  This includes using appropriate grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. Some examples that represent but do not constitute all of Level 1 performance are: Use punctuation marks correctly.\nIdentify Standard English grammatical structures and refer to resources for correction.\n",

      "description": "Higher order thinking is central and knowledge is deep at Level 4.  The standard or assessment item at this level will probably be an extended activity, with extended time provided. The extended time period is not a distinguishing factor if the required work is only repetitive and does not require applying significant conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking.  Students take information from at least one passage and are asked to apply this information to a new task.  They may also be asked to develop hypotheses and perform complex analyses of the connections among texts. Some examples that represent but do not constitute all of Level 4 performance are: Analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources.\nExamine and explain alternative perspectives across a variety of sources. Describe and illustrate how common themes are found across texts from different cultures.",

      "description": "Deep knowledge becomes more of a focus at Level 3.  Students are encouraged to go beyond the text; however, they are still required to show understanding of the ideas in the text.  Students may be encouraged to explain, generalize, or connect ideas.  Standards and items at Level 3 involve reasoning and planning.  Students must be able to support their thinking.  Items may involve abstract theme identification, inference across an entire passage, or students’ application of prior knowledge.  Items may also involve more superficial connections between texts. Some examples that represent but do not constitute all of Level 3 performance are: Determine the author’s purpose and describe how it affects the interpretation of a reading selection.\nSummarize information from multiple sources to address a specific topic.\nAnalyze and describe the characteristics of various types of literature. ",

Intersentence analysis of inference is required.  Some important concepts are covered but not in a complex way.  Standards and items at this level may include words such as summarize, interpret, infer, classify, organize, collect, display, compare, and determine whether fact or opinion.  Literal main ideas are stressed. A Level 2 assessment item may require students to apply some of the skills and concepts that are covered in Level 1.
