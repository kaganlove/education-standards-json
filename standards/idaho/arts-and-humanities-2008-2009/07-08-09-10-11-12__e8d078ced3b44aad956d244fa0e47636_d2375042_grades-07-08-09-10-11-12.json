        "Level 2 students use the four language acquisition skills with an expanded, but still basic, vocabulary. Students comprehend aural input in longer and more complex pieces (up to several minutes of input at a time). Students follow classroom directions given in the target language. Students read longer (100 to 250 word) passages, which contain both familiar and unfamiliar vocabulary, and use a variety of strategies to decipher the unfamiliar pieces. Students write paragraph length texts about a variety of familiar topics, in a variety of settings (place and time). Students engage in more extended conversation about rehearsed topics with the teacher and respond to unrehearsed but familiar questions with appropriate language. Students present rehearsed information orally. All student output in the second year should be comprehensible to a sympathetic native speaker and/or teacher of the language."

Students comprehend the language in context when spoken slowly and clearly by teachers or teaching resources. Students read short, modified texts and differentiate symbols, words, questions, and statements. Students write in short simple sentences. Students speak in rehearsed responses to rehearsed questions. The output of a level one student is comprehensible to a sympathetic world languages teacher."
