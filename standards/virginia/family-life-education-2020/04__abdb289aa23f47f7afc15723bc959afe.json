Female characteristics presented include: increased width and\nroundness of hips, development of breasts, the pituitary gland that controls physical\ngrowth through hormones, the appearance of pubic and axillary hair, and the onset of the\nmenstrual cycle. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the onset of sexual changes and\ngrowth patterns varies with individuals and that this is natural and normal.

The importance of postponing sexual activity is discussed as is the\nimportance of delaying childbearing. In addition, the importance of personal hygiene in\nrelation to these bodily changes is discussed. When problems arise, teachers and parents\nare encouraged to continue working together in a team approach to problem solving.",
