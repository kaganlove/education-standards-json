      "description": "Instruction includes the steps in the decision-making process,\nproblem solving, and assertive communication skills. Using positive mental health\npractices, students relate decision-making and problem-solving skills to actual adolescent\nproblems--their own or situations presented in case problems. The effects of decisions on\nlifelong goals are emphasized, and students predict the possible outcomes of decisions\nmade. Students will discuss the permanency of misuse of social media and text\nmessaging including criminal penalties for engaging in sexually explicit communications.\nCareer and other options available are stressed as choices and are identified in the\ndecision-making process. ",
