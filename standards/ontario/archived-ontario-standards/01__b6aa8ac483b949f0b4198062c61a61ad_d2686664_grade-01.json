When the weather gets cold, people turn on heat in their homes; when the weather gets hotter they turn on fans, air conditioners, and pool heaters and pumps, all of which means that more energy is being used. At night in winter, when people get home from work and school, they all turn on appliances at around the same time [peak hours], which puts a strain on the power supplies. In summer, people increase their use of water to wash their cars and water their lawns and gardens; unless there is plenty of rain, this usage of water puts a strain on water supplies. In winter, it is harder for birds that do not migrate and animals that do not hibernate to find food and water. Some plants die when summer is over; others undergo changes, such as losing their leaves and going dormant until spring. The Anishinaabe people tell their stories only in the winter when there is snow on the ground.)",
