They are able to perform variations of different locomotor skills (e.g., jumping for height and distance; skipping at different speeds). By the end of third grade, students will be able to demonstrate all striking and throwing patterns. Students can catch a moving object from a high trajectory in non-game play environments and are able to catch objects at a medium level trajectory during game play."
