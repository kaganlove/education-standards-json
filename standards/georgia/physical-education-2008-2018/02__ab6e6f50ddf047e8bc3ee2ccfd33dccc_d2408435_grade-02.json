        "Students are expected to demonstrate mature form in skipping, sliding, and galloping as they move through personal and general space. The ability to change directions on teacher command or adapt movement in relation to a partner is expected for this age. Students can combine non-locomotor movements with manipulative and locomotor patterns in a variety of games and dances. The ability to demonstrate momentary body control during balance and weight transfer is evident. Students will demonstrate mastery of underhand throwing patterns when performing manipulative skills. The ability to catch an object at a medium level of trajectory is demonstrated in a closed environment (not during game play). Underhand striking skills are performed but are not at a mature level."
