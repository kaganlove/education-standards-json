Movement patterns are demonstrated with consistency and with good form. Some specialized skills, like those associated with sports, are refined and used in game play. Students demonstrate the ability to hit targets when performing manipulative skills. Students are able to combine movement in meaningful ways, creating movement sequences that are smooth and fluid and done to several different rhythmic patterns."
